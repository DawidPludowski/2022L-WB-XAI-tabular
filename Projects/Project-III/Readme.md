**Problem**: We want to determine the cost of treating different patients. The cost of treatment depends on many factors: diagnosis, type of clinic, city of residence and others. However, there is no information about the diagnosis in the data, but there is other information that can help draw conclusions.

**Data**: Medical Coat Personal Datasets data are available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance

The data set contains 1338 observations and 7 explanatory variables.

To prepare models related to the prediction of treatment costs, you should reproduce the notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/hely333/eda-regression

As part of the project, you can also train your models for comparison.
