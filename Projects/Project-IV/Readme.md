**Problem**: We want to model to predict the probability of a shot being scored. We want to evaluate the performance of a player or a team by calculating the xG metric over these prediction values.

**Data**: Scrape the dataset by using understat_league_season_shots() in {worldfootballR} package in R.
 
The data set should contains the observation of 5 major football league in Europe since 2014. To prepare models related to the prediction of xG metric, you should reproduce the four main research questions in the paper: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-64912-8_2.

As part of the project, you can also train your models for comparison.
