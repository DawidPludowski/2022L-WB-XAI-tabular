**Problem**: The dataset describes properties of the houses in California. We want to model the median house price for households within the block (measured in US dollars).

**Data**: Data includes house prices in California available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/california-housing-prices.

The dataset contains 20K observations and 10 explanatory variables.

To prepare models related to the prediction of median house price, please reproduce the notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/ravichaubey1506/end-to-end-machine-learning,
